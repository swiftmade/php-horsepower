# PHP Horse Power 🐎

WIP

A utility library for ext-v8js. Run Javascript code inside PHP.

### Features:


* 📦 Support for requiring npm packages, both from PHP and JS
* ⚠️ Option to supress runtime exceptions and get them as error objects
* 📜 Built-in log feature to easily append logs from your JS code to a PHP array.
* 🔝 Access your variables as top level JS vars instead of using `PHP.` notation.
